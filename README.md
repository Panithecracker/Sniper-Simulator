# Sniper-Simulator
This is a game-like interactive simulator in 2D where a sniper rifle laying on a bipod is positioned in the center of the screen and with the keyboard or PS4 controller you can rotate it and shoot at random targets. The bullet flight is affected by gravity, rifle's bullet speed, rifle geometry, shooting angle and potentially wind and air drag.
